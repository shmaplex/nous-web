# Nous Foundation Website

Welcome to the **Nous Foundation** website — building open, decentralized intelligence.  
This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). Our website showcases decentralized news, tools, and open-source projects.
